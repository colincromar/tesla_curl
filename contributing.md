## Issues

When opening an issue:

* include the full **backtrace** with your error
* include the relevant Tesla.Env data
* include any output from TeslaCurl generated, with sensitive data redacted
* list versions you are using: Elixir, Erlang, TeslaCurl, OS, etc.

It's always better to include more info rather than less.

Fork the project and submit a pull request. Please include tests for any changes.

## Code

It is recommended to open an issue before investing a lot of time into a
fix or new functionality. Any new functionality will be reviewed and must
meet my design goals and vision for the project to be accepted. I am happy
to discuss how your idea can best fit into TeslaCurl.
